# Non Negative Matrix Factorization to find disease subtypes

This repository contains R script to perform Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The input for this script requires .csv file where rows contain the genomic events and the columns contain the patients. The matrix contains discrete values such as 0 (event absent) and 1 (event present). The ouput consists of a pdf file showing the subtypes at a chosen membership threshold.
